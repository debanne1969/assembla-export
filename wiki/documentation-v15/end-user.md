      <p>The following End User Documentation html file for FileSender 1.5 may be downloaded and customised for local installations of FileSender. <b>Systems administators please note</b>:</p>
<ul>
<li>This file does not contain links to any stylesheets. The contents are suitable for use with FileSender's own stylesheet, should you choose
 to incorporate the body of this file into the body of the "Help" section of the FileSender interface (see section 4.8 of the [[Administrator reference manual 1-5]]). Alternatively, please add a link to your site's stylesheet(s) to this file, as well as any related tags where applicable.</li>
<li>Remove the reference to the "Acceptable Usage Policy" in section 1.a of this file, if this does not apply to your local installation.</li>
<li>Figure links, captions and references have been inserted as comments into this file. If you wish to use these, please uncomment them and insert links to screenshots of your local installation where indicated. (See [[End User Documentation for v1-0]] for an example from FileSender 1.0.x).</li>
<li>In the "Help" section of the FileSender interface (see section 4.8 of the [[Administrator reference manual 1-5]]), to suit your local installation you may need to amend the suggestion that users with login issues contact their local IT support.</li>
<li>Client requirements, as well as imposed and configured local limitations, are already summarised in the "Help" section of the FileSender interface (see section 4.8 of the [[Administrator reference manual 1-5]]), and so are not repeated in this file. See also the [[Requirements for v1-5]] wikipage for more information on client (and server) requirements.</li>
<li>Changes from the version of this file for 1.1 are noted in the [[url:https://www.assembla.com/code/file_sender/subversion/changesets/1957|revision log]].</li>
