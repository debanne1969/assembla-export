FileSender uses three mailinglists and a ticketing system:

 * [[#Announcements]]: filesender-announce@filesender.org
 * [[#Support and development discussion]]: filesender-dev@filesender.org
 * [[#Bugs]]: report bugs via the ticketing system
 * [[#Auto-alerts]]: Automatic alerts of SVN commits and bug tickets: filesender-alerts@filesender.org
<br/>

##Announcements
The FileSender project uses a mailinglist to announce new releases and important news:

         filesender-announce@filesender.org

To subscribe send an email to _sympa@filesender.org_ with _'subscribe filesender-announce'_ in the subject or the body of the mail.  Alternatively you can go to the [Sympa mailinglist server web interface](https://postlister.uninett.no/sympa_filesender/info/filesender-announce) and subscribe yourself there.

[The mailinglist archive can be found here](https://postlister.uninett.no/sympa_filesender/arc/filesender-announce)
<br/>

##Support and development discussion
The FileSender project uses one mailinglist to coordinate the development and provide support to the user community:

         filesender-dev@filesender.org

To subscribe send an email to _sympa@filesender.org_ with _'subscribe filesender-dev'_ in the subject or the body of the mail.  Alternatively you can go to the [Sympa mailinglist server web interface](https://postlister.uninett.no/sympa_filesender/info/filesender-dev) and subscribe yourself there. 

Non-subscribers can also send emails to the list - note that those emails are moderated by one of three list-owners, so it can take a little while before your email gets through.
