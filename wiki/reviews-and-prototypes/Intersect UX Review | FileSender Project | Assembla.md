</p>
<p style="margin:0px; font-size:12px">After asking colleagues for a 
secure australian file sending service, I was directed to the Cloudstor 
website. The About page and Help page appeared in pop-ups which was 
different, and I had to visit the 'file sender' page
 to get detailed information. It would have been nice to have some of 
that information summarised on the Cloudstor about page. I found it 
irritating that neither the page banner nor the logo(s) in the banner 
were clickable links. After logging in (some instructions
 about how to acquire login details, who to ask etc would be welcome for
 the un-initiated), being taken directly to the 'Send Files' page was 
nice as that's what I logged in for.</p>
<p style="margin:0px; font-size:12px; min-height:14px"><br>
</p>
<p style="margin:0px; font-size:12px">The file form was simple, but I 
wondered where the send or submit button was (until I uploaded a file), 
and the emails it sends are clear, and simple for the recipient to 
understand.  The management of 'Vouchers' (not sure
 if this word correctly conveys the concept) was simple, but the icons 
for management were not immediately obvious.</p>
<p style="margin:0px; font-size:12px; min-height:14px"><br>
</p>
<p style="margin:0px; font-size:12px">Overall, the website provides it's
 promised functionality in a straight-forward way. Small details could 
be improved, but they do not impair it's use.</p>

<p style="margin:0px; font-size:12px; min-height:14px"><br>
</p>
<p style="margin:0px; font-size:12px">- Home: Logos are not links 
(clickable). Logos should lead to their respective websites. Cloudstor 
should go to 'Home', or refresh.</p>
<p style="margin:0px; font-size:12px">- Home: Top buttons 'Send Files', 
'Guest Voucher' and 'My Files' should be changed from buttons to tabs, 
as buttons indicate an action. I.e. 'Log Off' should remain as a button.
 'Help', and 'About' should be links.</p>
<p style="margin:0px; font-size:12px">- Send-Files:  Instructions on right are somewhat serpurflous. Could be move into 'placeholder' text inside fields.</p>
<p style="margin:0px; font-size:12px">- Email: Clear and easy to understand</p>
<p style="margin:0px; font-size:12px">- Guest Vouchers: Vouchers does not seem to match the concept. Change the text to 'Guest Passes'.)</p>
<p style="margin:0px; font-size:12px">- Guest Vouchers: Expiry should have a radio option for day, week, month and then free-text date.</p>
<p style="margin:0px; font-size:12px">- My Files: Icons are less informative than words in this case. Either words or words + icons would be helpful</p>
