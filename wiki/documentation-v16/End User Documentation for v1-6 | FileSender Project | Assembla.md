 to incorporate the body of this file into the body of the "Help" section of the FileSender interface (see section 4.9 of the [[Administrator reference manual]]). Alternatively, please add a link to your site's stylesheet(s) to this file, as well as any related tags where applicable. </p></li>
<li><p>Remove the reference to the "Acceptable Usage Policy" in section 1.a of this file, if this does not apply to your local installation.</p></li>
<li><p>If download notification emails to the file recipient have been disabled for your local installation, remove "and the file recipient" from the third bullet point of section 3 of this file.</p></li>
<li><p>Figure links, captions and references have been inserted as comments into this file. If you wish to use these, please uncomment them and insert links to screenshots of your local installation where indicated.

<li><p>In the "Help" section of the FileSender interface (see section 4.9 of the [[Administrator reference manual]]), to suit your local installation you may need to amend the suggestion that users with login issues contact their local IT support.</p></li>
<li><p>Client requirements, as well as imposed and configured local limitations, are already summarised in the "Help" section of the FileSender interface (see section 4.9 of the [[Administrator reference manual]]), and so are not repeated in this file.
