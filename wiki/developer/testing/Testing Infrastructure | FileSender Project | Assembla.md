Automated build testing
=======================

There is a [Hudson installation](http://filesender-dev.surfnet.nl/hudson/) available which can be used for automated building of filesender and testing the build. This is described on the [[automated build]] page. If you would like access, please contact the -dev list (see [[Support and Mailinglists]]).

Automated workflow testing
=======================

Work is underway to create [[Automated Workflow Tests]] of the latest code, using [Selenium](http://seleniumhq.org/).
