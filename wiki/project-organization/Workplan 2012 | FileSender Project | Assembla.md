<h1><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">How to read this workplan</span></h1>
<p>FileSender is an agile project.  This means our workplan is by no means written in stone but is adapted as circumstances warrant and opportunities allow.  There is a very good idea on where we want to get but the road there is not always clear and without bumps.  This affects release planning and that is reflected in work plan changes.</p>
<h1>Way of working</h1>
<p>In 2011 we ended up doing several big feature improvements simultaneously which lead to complications, dispersed focus of the core-team and a long lead time for these features to become available in a release.  In 2012 we will try a different approach.  Using the 1.5 release as our stable foundation, we will focus on releasing earlier and more often, in smaller increments.  The core-team will be focussed on one chunk at a time.  Depending on the impact of that chunk the result will be a minor or a major release.  Features developed outside the core-team will have to wait their turn to be integrated in the main stable code trunk.</p>
<p> </p>
<h1>Work scheduling and planning</h1>
<p>The details of the work we plan to undertake are in the tickets, under milestone "Planned features".  We plan for so much work as we can focus on, when a batch of work is done we look at "Suggested features" and select a new batch.</p>
