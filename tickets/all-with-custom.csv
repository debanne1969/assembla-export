A feature request came in on the feature request forum, by James M: https://filesender.uservoice.com/admin/users/32753502-james-m

It sounds like a good idea to enable this.  It would fit best in the new MyFiles, the one from QWA.  We already have a list of the dates a file is downloaded on, in the expanded view.  The IP address is stored in the database.  So all we need is:
-to display the ip address next to the download date, show ipv4 or ipv6 address 
-implement a config.php switch ""show download user ip address in myfiles"" to either show or not show download ip addresses in MyFiles

We'll start with IP address, but would be good to have a look at whether resolving the ip address makes sense.  It is a bit tricky, as we don't store the resolving  result in the database, so would mean ""live"" resolving resulting in possible slower display of MyFiles, not preferable.  Now that I write this, it sounds like a bad idea to do resolving live.  Might be a nice phase2 change for this functionality, with database change to store resolving result ""on download"".

I just tested a 200 GB upload, my laptop crashed for some non-related reason (I hope) about 5GB before the upload was done.

Should be institution specific in cases where such information is included with user credentials (will need an additional logs table field).  

Could be done as an optional cron job. Storing parsed data in an additional DB table specifically for this purpose might be best, although all stats can be retrieved from the logs table.

Input Xander: if org-attribuut then instelling = org-attribuut else instelling = domein authuseremail

Implement stats both as email and once queries are settled, implement as ""stats"" tab.

About access control: lets start with what we concluded in the stats module but without the ""user"".  
$config['stats_access_level'] = 'statsadmin'; // Who can access stats page. Possible settings are 'statsadmin', 'public' or 'disabled'. A more restrictive setting here would override the access settings below.

To start with the key stats from the stats module are probably useful.  Would be wonderful to have those key stats both per filesender instans and per institution.   Would also be helpful to be able to indicate different timeperiods (up to 10?) you'd like to see next to eachother for easy comparison, for example key stats for 2010-2013, or for march 2012 vs. march 2013, especially when thinking of visiting institutions for marketing purposes etc.

*Note: we do need to discuss the need for anonimisation/aggregation: do we already do this for a simple stats function in 2.0 ""asap"" or would we postpone it to after we have the key numbers?*  First thought: let us focus on making key numbers per instans and site available ASAP, based on current database tables.  Phase 2: once key stats have stabilised, work out proper way for anonimisation and aggregation, possibly prepared for phase 3: allow sending aggregates/anonimised stats to centralised collector.

The file is however correctly downloaded and usable.  

The ""Content-Dispositon"" problem

At the moment the labeling of a string as UTF-8 encoded is not done when a file containing special characters is downloaded. The download process uses the HTTP Content-Disposition header with a filename parameter. This header is only defined for filenames containing characters from the (single byte) ISO-8859-1 character set.

Although there are currently ongoing standardisation efforts to make it possible to use other character sets there is no universally adopted way of transmitting a UTF-8 encoded filename yet (see http://greenbytes.de/tech/webdav/draft-ietf-httpbis-content-disp-latest.html for details). The current filesender code therefore relies on what is called 'encoding sniffing' in browsers such as FireFox, Chrome and Safari. Internet Explorer can only handle ISO-8859-1 (single byte) encoded filenames.

We might consider 'fixing' this in FileSender by normalizing 'decomposed unicode' to 'precomposed unicode'. 

Considerations:
- The normalizer_normalize function of the PHP intl extension can be used for this, this requires PHP 5.3+ and adds extra dependencies (php5-intl, libicu)
- Should we normalize when uploading (before storing the filename into the database) or only when displaying/downloading?

1123,Handling decomposed unicode in filenames,Release 1.6,Xander Jansen (bkpnJ4jEWr37jceJe5afGb),,,Low,Deferred,Not Completed,,2014-07-22,0.0,FileSender,0.0,0.0,2.0,-,1.0,0.0,"On (at least) Mac OSX filenames with certain Unicode characters tend to be represented as 'decomposed unicode' (see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode_equivalence for an explanation). Although FileSender transparantly handles those decomposed characters and leaves the actual handling to the browser and OS it looks like most notably Windows (when storing a file with 'decomposed unicode' characters from FireFox/Chrome) and IE11 (when displaying those files in My Files or a download page) doesn't handle those characters as expected.

We might consider 'fixing' this in FileSender by normalizing 'decomposed unicode' to 'precomposed unicode'. 

Considerations:
- The normalizer_normalize function of the PHP intl extension can be used for this, this requires PHP 5.3+ and adds extra dependencies (php5-intl, libicu)
- Should we normalize when uploading (before storing the filename into the database) or only when displaying/downloading?

- another reverts to filesender sending emails as itself (omitting the impersonation), and making use of additional code to tag outgoing emails and parse their headers should they bounce, thus enabling filesender to forward any bounces to the sending user.

=========
Good email:

Content-Type:text/plain; charset=""utf-8""; format=flowed

Content-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable

=========

Not encoding the mail as quoted printable by changing utils/Mail.class.php seems to help:

// Encode contents
//        $plain = quoted_printable_encode($plain);


Etienne thinks: mime headers are not being considered by mail client because somehow a double carriage return is introduced.  So quoted printable header is not being interpreted as a header.  Then you get garbled header.  What introduces double carriage returns in stead of single ones as we set in FileSender.

For some reason the outgoing SMTP server might be using old LF character (single \n rather than \r\n).  This can be tested easily.  

Modify file classes/constants GlobalConstants.class.php and remove \r.

If this now works it means SMTP server doesn't use \r\n for new lines, perhaps replaces \r by \n.

Flash: ""Browse"" button locked (grayed out), Upload button becomes ""Cancel"" button, name and size stays the same and is followed by a nice green progress bar below

Initially the configuration was implemented with a single URL-style dsn parameter. For various reasons it was decided to implement this slightly different to both ease packaging and make the upgrade path (from 1.0.1 to 1.5) a bit 'safer'.

In config.php (as distributed): replace all pg_* settings with db_* settings (make the prefix db-independent) and add a db_type parameter

In the code (DBAL.php): check the config settings according to the following flow:

1) check if dsn is defined/set
2) check if db_* parameters + db_type are defined/set
3) check pg_* parameters are defined/set
4) error

For cases 2) and 3) construct a dsn (with possible defaults like host and port if not explicitly set)

Logging of SimpleSAMLphp seems to indicate the user is not logged on, no authenticated session is created.

FileSender 2.0 explicitly sets the session.cookie.path to the site URL on initialisation.  Usually this points to / and won't cause any
issues for the standard setup with simplesamlphp where simplesamlphp is in a separate URL space from
FileSender.

However, on my testing machine and for example for launching our filesender.uninett.no/beta service this
is a bit different and hence sessions between simplesamlphp and filesender are not accepted by filesender.
With Shibboleth this is not an issue as it uses its own session variable handling.  SimpleSAMLphp is in php and shares with PHP.

Agreed solution: introduce a configuration parameter session_cookie_path.  When using SimpleSAMLphp in a URL path other than /, you need to configure this to for example /.  

If the parameter is not set, FileSender uses the default application path which is either specified in site_url or extracted from the application environment.

Within our organisation there was the desire that files get not simply unlinked when they are expired but are wiped from disk by overwriting them with random data. This tries to combat the effect of filesender's filestore becoming a goldmine of assorted documents that would be easy to recover - somewhat like the infamous printer hard drives.

Attached patch implements this. The wiping happens at night, so I think usually it will not matter much that it takes a little bit longer than unlinking. I did add a configurable option for it, for sites that don't want this functionality; the default is set to true now because I reasoned that it normally doesn't hurt, and there will probably only be a few sites for which it's necessary to turn it off. Still, I can imagine that you want to pick another default for this.

It makes use of GNU coreutils shred, which I think can safely be assumed to be available given the ""Linux"" requirement of filesender.

Looks like it may be an IE10 Compatibility mode browser issue.

https://connect.microsoft.com/IE/feedback/details/774078

http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/12577

IE 10 compativility mode causes a ""SCRIPT3: Member not found"" script error which stops all scripts.

Without being able to fix the issue in IE we can add 
<meta http-equiv=""X-UA-Compatible"" content=""IE=edge""> to the head of index.php and this will force IE to not use compativility mode. Stops the issue happening if someone tries to use IE10-Compatibility mode.

Doesn’t solve the issue of what is really causing the problem which seems to be a browser issue.

This may lead to a situation where a user can overwrite any variable in the current symbol table like a path variable and include a php script controlled by the user like a php script included in a URL.  At the moment this is not exploitable as the user doesn't control the keys that are provided with the vars parameter.   In future versions this might change. 

Pine recommends to switch to a different mechanism like a key/value store.

*Assessment:* This is currently not a problem as there is no flow that allows a user to call the template method.  Implementing a  key/value store approach makes writing templates heavier.  For the time being we will keep this as it is and gather practical experience with the template mechanism.

Details: In the template class there's a method that when called renders a template.  This method looks for a template, resolves the template path (is it in the config directory because it's a customised template or is it in the default template directory?).  Then it includes that template file if found while creating on the fly a set of varilables that the template will use.  The method is given an associated array of key-value pairs (foo=bar) and creates variables for use in the template with name 'foo' and value 'bar'.     .  It could become

issue confirmed and needs to be addressed.  Using a key/value store approach makes writing templates heavier.  Hesitating between rewrite using some kind of keystore or filtering given variables before creating variables so they don't contain unexpected stuff like globals etc., path variable.  The latter approach is error-prone, every time we introduce variable we also need to update the filter.

When rendering for example a report at end of upload, the template process method with template name ""report"" can have a variable report=array of report objects.  In template code this then allows for a construct like ""foreach $report as report do ...."".  

This mechanism is to make for easier template writing.   It is currently not directly exploitable and needs significant other bad programming practice to make this exploitable. 

A possible future exploit: if at some point user input is fed directly to the template processing function, it could give a set of variables that could have post data.

*Response:* this is not exploitable and needs significant bad programming practice to make it exploitable.  We will gain practical experience with the template mechanism to see if the balance ease of use vs. security in depth needs to be different in future versions.

Normally an e-mail containing an error message will be sent to the e-mail address in ""Return-Path:"" field.

Either we document the risks with using iframes or ensure they can't be used.

*Assessment*: this is both a risk and a feature.  Integrating FileSender using an iframe is a feature.  Should you want to limit inclusion of FileSender in iframes, preliminary investigation suggests W3C's candidate recommendation Content Security Policy (CSP, http://www.w3.org/TR/CSP2/) is the standards-based way to do this.  According to http://caniuse.com/#feat=contentsecuritypolicy this is supported on most currrent browsers.  IE11 is supported by adding X-Content-Security-Policy. Daan suggests to set the same-origin header in the Apache config.   

*Response*: as this is both a feature and a vulnerability we will not enforce this in the FileSender application.  We will use CSP to allow for fine-grained protection.  Rather than implement a swath of config options in FileSender we will document how to configure CSP in Apache for use with FileSender to prevent inclusion in iframes.

This function currently filters the input for a number of dangerous characters and adds a space to them. Pine recommends to use escaping, the current code uses filtering.

Filtering changes the input and might lead to unexpected side-effects.

*Assessment*: Etienne's collegues in the Sympa mailinglist software project had a security audit executed where an issue was found using variable encoded string injection.  The offending string had to be machine-generated.  This string defeated perls regexp-based entity encoding mechanism.  The php mechanism behaved the same.  Sympa introduced a filtering fix which was reported in this FileSender audit.  
The filtering fix was based on a blog-article published on OWASP as a recommendation.  Unfortunately the blog article is now no longer accessible. 

Daan indicated he's unaware of any technique to bypass html_entities.  He tested by removing the line of code and injection of code was not possible.  The strong recommendation is to not filter on input; you don't know where the data will be used.

*Response:* there is not yet consensus in the FileSender core team on the best approach.  Based on the experience of the Sympa mailinglist software team escaping alone might not be enough.  The issue found in the Sympa security audit might now have been fixed and the filtering fix no longer needed.  We will await the results of the 2nd security audit and then decide what to do.  We will address this before the 2.0 release.

The reviewd 2.0 codebase uses uniq_id and mt_rand.  Both don't return a sufficiently secure random number which may result in an attacker guessing the state of the random generator.  An attacker might thus be able to guess download URLs and CSRF tokens.  Recommend to use secure random generator.

*Assessment:* Issue confirmed and needs to be addressed before the 2.0 release.  Preferably without using openssl as it would add a dependency and be about 100 times (ballpark figure)  slower than using the other random generator.

The unique identifiers used in FileSender need to have two characteristics:
•	the ID must be unique
•	the ID must be non-guessable.  As long as you can't guess the random number in the ID you can't guess the random generator state.  

For the FileUID we check uniqueness, if a collision occurs we generate a new one.   To make the ID non-guessable Pine recommends a HMAC.  The recommendation is to use a secure random number generator like openssl but using for example /dev/urandom or mtrand and hash that combined with a salt value to an HMAC is sufficiently secure.  FileSender would need to auto-generate the salt value.

Pine comments that wile an attacker in this way won't be able to directly know the random number you have to be very careful you don't leak random number to user somewhere. 

*Response:*  Etienne will add HMAC with a random generated salt and look at making it configurable to read urandom or use mt_rand.

Etienne's analysis:

* When last worker finishes: triggers file complete request.  When all files are complete, transfer complete request is sent.  Normally triggers mail sending etc.
* After this transfer complete request was sent another chunk was sent.  The webservice doesn’t accept chunks after a transfer complete is sent.  the client should NOT send chunks after transfer complete.
* this MAY happen in one case only, with the automatic restart of stalled transfers.
* There are TWO automatic restarts of a transfer before asking whether a transfer should restart so a user won't see if a transfer restarts only once

There might be a situation where the transfer is both complete and restarted.  Etienne will add more logging to see if restarts have an unfortunate timing.

Allow to configure client stalling detection.

Related config parameter is ""stalling_detection"", it may be :

- A true boolean to enable detection with default behaviour :
$config['stalling_detection'] = true;

- An array including any of the following values (all optional) :
count_divergence : the maximum chunk count a worker can be late over the global average (last 5 chunks of every worker)
duration_divergence : the maximum ratio between a process's current upload time and the global average (last 5 chunks of every worker)
automatic_retries : the number of times the upload is resumed transparently before asking the user if he/she wants to keep going

Full version is (those are also the default values) :

$config['stalling_detection'] = array(
'count_divergence' => 10,
'duration_divergence' => 7,
'automatic_retries' => 3
);

- A false boolean to turn off detection :
$config['stalling_detection'] = false;

Confirmed on UNINETT and DeIC 2.0 test install.  Symptom: just nothing happens and nothing is logged.

Set the number of workers to 16 and it also works with FireFox.

Etienne provides following feedback:

The mechanism in a terasender upload is as follows:
- a worker requests a job with the terasender job driver
- the job driver locks (sets boolean in itself) so it doesn't respond to multiple workers.  If another worker tries to access it it tells the other worker to wait.  This ensures no chunk is given to two workers.
- the driver gives a worker an answer; either ""here is a chunk for you"" or ""nothing more to do"".

if this messaging mechanism breaks down nothing will work.

Thoughts:
- maybe past a certain number of workers with each worker waiting for .5 seconds, with a lot of workers it may be just waiting?
- maybe there's some overflow in the messaging system in FireFox?
- upon checking the upload console: every worker is requesting a job.  First worker is given file, other worker gets “nothing to do” as a response.  Are expected to close.  First worker doesn’t even signal worker is complete.  Past specific number of workers the browser starts to handle events in a bad way.
-Is the bug related to max number of workers or to large number of workers combined with async uplods?
-what is the breaking number?  
-maybe there is a limit in the global amount of “work” FireFox can do?  That Safari and Chrome doesn’t have?  Does messaging just break down?

Etienne will take following actions:
- test to see if there is a specific fixed breaking point in # webworkers
- check Mozilla email list for similar issues and write email asking others if they've seen similar things
- post on Stack overflow

This is not a high priority issue at the moment: just don't set the #webworkers to 30 does the trick.  But we need to figure out what causes this.  If it's a firefox bug it should be fixed.  If it is some issue in our code it should be fixed.  

For the 2.0-alpha we will -unless we find out what causes it- label this as a known issue for now.",2015-02-11,2015-02-11,,false,946 days,946 days,946 days,,,,,

Subject: [filesender-dev] [feature] configurable attribute names

Hi,

I would like the hardcoded attribute names in fs_param.php to be
configurable through config/config.xml since variable names can
differ between different IDPs/federations. Eg. we now have for
SURFfederatie:

  $username = $session->getAttribute('urn:mace:dir:attribute-def:displayName');
  $useremail =  $session->getAttribute('urn:mace:dir:attribute-def:mail');

instead of the default ""short"" names that come in version 0.1.3.

Thanks,

Hans.

Subject: [filesender-dev] [feature] version 0.1.3 database creation script

Hi,

Can I suggest to drop te ""WITH (OIDS=FALSE)"" clause from the
table creation statements?

It seems to be incompatibile with PostgreSQL 8.1.18 which comes with
Redhat Enterprise Linux 5.4; above that there's also a ""default_with_oids""
configuration parameter which sorts it out for newer installations on
a system level.

This way at least the PostgreSQL version requirement can be narrowed
down from ""latest version"" to "">= 8.1.18"".

Regards,

Hans.

Pause should *temporarily* stop the uploading of files until the user chooses to resume them (via the same button). Using this will *not* allow the user to resume after leaving this page and is used to relieve the users bandwidth temporarily.

Suspend should make it possible for users to stray away from the transaction and continue it as part of another session, this would be an explicit version of the pause/resume functionality which is currently in place. Users should be warned after choosing 'suspend' of how it works and the steps required to come back to this transaction. This should be paired with functionality which tells users they have a pending upload transaction and should continue to ask them if they wish to either continue with the upload or cancel it. 
This will only work when the user uses the same browser&computer combination to resume the upload.
Some way, for example via a button/dropdown list/dialog for the user to access a list of their suspended transactions. This stops the user from having to repopulate the list themselves and would essentially make the uploads page re-appear how they left if (any file uploads complete in that transaction would still be there with complete progress bars). Suspended transactions should have some form of expiration date. Requires validations/error checks to ensure the pending files still exist on disk.

Cancel should forfeit the transaction and stop *all* files (both those already finished and those in the queue). Downloads do not have to be paused to be cancelled, but a warning 'are you sure?' should be provided.

This turns out to be correct, it doesn't work when you POST using a script.  

After discussion with Chris there look to be two complementary ways of solving this.

1. make a hidden form that posts to a hidden iframe or something, to ensure the form data is saved locally in the browser
2. use jquery autocomplete and query the files database for all To: addresses the particular user has sent to in the past.  Present that in a selectable list that's easy to grasp and use.

The one issue with (2) is that it becomes less functional should a site operator choose to prune the database for old records.  We can present that in a positive way ""we do this to ensure your address list is always up to date and never polluted with addresses that don't work"".  I don't really know what the user expectation would be so suggest we ask around a bit and try out.

The current process I envision after 2.0:

- we have a list of feature suggestions somewhere
- at some point in time we start working on a new release.  For example release 2.1.
- release 2.1 will have a number of feature tickets under it.  
- once we pick up on a suggestion we mark the suggestion as ""underway"" in the feature suggestion list and relate it to the relevant feature implementation ticket
- in the feature suggestion list the feature is closed once the feature is implemented.

A challenge at the moment is that we have a feature suggestion forum at uservoice and a list of suggested features in Assembla.  These should be consolidated at some point in time.  A challenge with this is that Uservoice has removed its free offer from its pricing structure.  At the moment we can still use it but I don't feel comfortable this'll last forever.  In any case it is not a desirable situation to be in.

The FileSender project uses openidp.feide.no as an IdP for the following purposes:

1. test accounts for (automated, selenium-based) client-side testing.
2. ensuring federated login is tested before we release 
3. as the default IdP new FileSender installations can authenticate against.  This ensures the 1-hour setup time.
4. as a self-registration user account system for demo (test) instances

Considerations with the purpose 1, use for test accounts:
- the credentials need to be able to be exposed to external services without problems, like selenium service providers.  Credential exposure should not lead to possible compromise of other services
- we need to be able to specify which email addresses are associated with the test accounts

Considerations with purpose 3, use by new FileSender instances to test their installation
- no default username/password should be distributed with a FileSender release

""Add a way to use webservice as a remote user (!= remote application).

It must be enabled using the auth_remote_user_enabled configuration parameter (boolean, false by default).

It uses a signed request (same as remote applications), the only difference is that each user have its own secret (stored as a preference).

Secrets can be automatically generated by setting auth_remote_user_autogenerate_secret configuration parameter to true (false by default).

It will allow to setup per-user based trust relationships between a filesender instance and other, potentially non-web based, applications.

Use case is a Thunderbird plugin which allows to put big files on filesender, user installs the plugin and give its secret to it, then the plugin can upload files on behalf of the user.

Sample php client has been updated to be able to use either remote application or remote user authentication.

Add a configurable user profile page (disabled by default).

The goal is to create a framework for user preferences managment.

To enable it set the ""user_page"" configuration parameter to an array containing <preference_id> : <view_mode> pairs.

View modes can be ""read"", ""write"" or false (same as not set, that is will not be displayed).

Supported preferences are :

  - lang (requires lang_userpref_enabled to true) : supports read and write
  - auth_secret (requires auth_remote_user_enabled), supports only read
  - created, supports only read

Changeset alert by etiennemeleard in project FileSender 

.............................................................................

Add a way to specify custom transfer validator to conduct further checks after usual checks (size, number of recipients ...)

This is configured using the transfer_validators configuration parameter which must be an array of callables.

Each test gets the transfer object as sole argument and can either return false (reject without reason given) or throw a standard exception with a translatable id as message (messages can easily be
translated in config lang files overrides).

Example :

$config['transfer_validators'] = array(
    function($transfer) {
        $blacklist = array_filter(explode(""\n"", file_get_contents(FILESENDER_BASE.'/config/blacklist.txt')));
        
        return !in_array(Auth::user()->id, $blacklist);
    },
    function($transfer) {
        if(!count(array_filter($transfer->files, function($file) {
            return $file->size > 10 * 1024 * 1024;
        })))
            throw new Exception('you_must_have_at_least_one_file_over_10mb');
    }

Adding an option to get a link for download instead of sending to recipient (disabled by default).

When using this an anonymous recipient is created (that is, without email) and its download link is given back to the uploader at the end of upload.

When using this option the user can embbed the link in any mail of his choice (newsletter for example), all downloads are obviously counted as done by the single anonymous recipient.

This mode will be helpful for people wanting to use their FileSender server from another application (like big attachments handling in mail clients).

This option must be enabled in the transfer_options configuration associative array under the name get_a_link (advanced mode is ignored as well as default).

Also adding user id in user page (if enabled).

We could then just adapt in the configuration the footer text.

For keeping the current fonctionnality, you could add in the default language the following line:
$lang['FOOTER']='Version '.FileSender_Version::VERSION;

This is unfortunate as the IdP controls when that session times out.  Experience from the Norwegian install show that uploads lasting longer than 8 hours suffer from session timeout at the IdP: the Norwegian identity federation IdP has a timeout after 8 hours.

There are several factors in SimpleSAMLphp that the SP controls but one it doesn't:  SessionNotOnOrAfter is sent in the SAML response from IdP to SP.  Olav Morken writes:

"" It is also sent from the IdP to the SP, in the
      ""SessionNotOnOrAfter"" attribute. The SP is supposed to use this
      to determine when the session expires. In practice, this means
      that the IdP can force the SP to reauthenticate more often than
      whatever the SP has set in 'session.duration'. ""

https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#!topic/simplesamlphp/ERlbkoFpntw

It's the SessionNotOnOrAfter that bites us.  The implication is that when a FileSender upload lasts longer than SessionNotOnOrAfter ( 8 hours in Norway) the user gets a ""you're no longer authenticated"" message.  

A solution is to change how FileSender deals with this: define a FileSender valid upload session, that remains valid for as long as an upload runs.  Only *after* the upload is completed will the IdP be asked again whether the user still has a valid session.  This means an upload will complete and should the user want to upload another file, a new session needs to be established if the old one has expired.

A big advantage with pulling control over upload session validity into FileSender.  Xander reports this should not be too complicated.

Xander's list of points of consideration:
- be aware of session hijacking etc.  The ""FileSender valid upload session"" should only be valid for a specific browser/client upload that started after normal authentication.  Probably a combination of sessionId and unique upload token (something we already have?)
- such an upload token needs its own expiry, e.g. if 15 minutes without a new chunk then lose validity as AuthN token
- what to do with the combination uploadcomplete and timedout SSP-session?  We need to present ""your upload has completed"" page.

Following well established engineering principles ""what isn't there can't be abused"" FileSender ought to be optimised to minimise the data privacy footprint of its users.  This also minimises possible exposure in case a FileSender instance should be compromised.  

This means logging least possible, by default deleting possibly sensitive logging in a timely fashion and in general ensure FileSender admins don't have (easy) access to privacy sensitive information.  It also means deleting privacy sensitive entries from the database, either by anonimising the privacy sensitive bits (like we did in the stats module) or by deleting them.

In particular we need to remove data that details communication meta-data: who sends what to whom.  It's probably OK to have such an overview on the institutional/domain level, but not on personal level.  When should it be purged?  After expire of the file/transaction or based on a time limit?  What about the audit trail?  Once purged, the audit trail disappears.  How does this work with the database being backup-ed?  What about sending the audit trail as an email to the sender?  What about making an ""incognito"" transaction? 

A number of FileSender features depend on having historical data available:
-auto-complete in the To: field
-the audit trail for a sender of a file, especially in the cases where the user chose to not receive emails of the file downloads
-other?

The audit trail might be an important one, with anecdotal evidence and logging suggesting a number of users use FileSender in particular for the email receipts.  A straight forward solution is to simply gather the audit trail in an email and send it to the sender of the file on purge of the record.  That way the audit trail is where it belongs (transaction owner) and it's not with us.

We need to think this through carefully but do need to address it in our 2.0 release.  We also need to check up on the EU plans on the data privacy directive update that's underway now, it would be great to already be fully compliant :)

for a release candidate to become a production release it needs to have been running production traffic with live users for at least two weeks on at least two release candidate test sites and shown no significant issues impairing service for the users, it can become the production (major) release.

This implies we need at least to FileSEnder release candidate sites.  A site would need to install a release candidate within a certain number of time after release, for example a week.  A release candidate site should typically get a heads up at least 2 weeks in advance before release.

I got a number of user reports about a file upload that went through just fine but the file seemed to be automatically deleted when you tried to download it.  So upload went fine, move went fine, email was sent out, download screen popped up, but download went bad.  Nothing significant in the logging.

After observing what goes on on our system I made these observations: observations:
 
1. on our install the php temp upload directory is set to /tmp rather then to /data/filesender/tmp
2. our FileSender files directory is /data/filesender/files
3. /tmp and /files are on different partitions.  That means that a move is an actual transfer, rather then just flipping a pointer in an inode.
4. our cleanup (expiry) cronjob ran every 5 minutes
 
This means the move from temp dir to filesender files dir takes time. With an 1.5 GB file this might intersect with the cronjob running.  If I read the cronjob's code correctly, it checks for files that do exist in the filestore but do not have a database entry associated with them.  If it founds such files, it deletes them.  In possibly the same cronjob run, it then notices a stale database entry that is then set to ""closed"".
 
Presto, the file has disappeared for the user.

The problem affects both 1.0.1 and 1.5.  There is a quick fix under discussion, which in practice will prevent the problem from occuring unless you configure your site explicitly to trigger it.

A scheduled periodic cleanup that throws away entries older than <configurable log-retention period> needs to be implemented.  Deployment wise this fits nicely after we have the working anonimizer (part of the statistics module).  That way we can keep the log data relevant for statistics, and throw away the non-anonimised logging.  A default retention period of 6 weeks sounds sane.

A first thought for implementation: make it part of the existing clean-up cronjob (found in filesender/cron/cron.php).  There's already interaction with the database there.  It would save a FileSender admin the hassle of setting up 2 cronjobs.

- consistently check and use the sendEmail return value 
- do this before logging or reporting a succesfull insert/update/message sent
- log failures somewhere?
- show an error to the user ('Error sending mail, please contact your administrator' ??)

Note that mail() can fail even after a succesfull insert/update so in general the upload/voucher-creation is OK. We might need a more specific message then, for example with a voucher people should create a new one after the administrator has found and fixed the problem. With an upload a resend should be fine in general (unless the problem was caused by the mail-adresses of course).

Viewing FileSender as a file transport channel, encryption is  preferably done end-to-end, where all data leaves the sender's client encrypted and gets decrypted on the receivers client.  The server should never see plaintext data.  If this is not viable, server-side encryption can be considered to improve ""at rest"" protection.  Note that the effects are different though:

* Client-side: data is *never* plain text on the server: a server hack would have no influence (provided the javascript served to users isn't changed ;)

* Server-side: data is plain-text on the server until encrypted *after* upload, and plaintext after decryption before download


Important constraints:
-encryption functionality must be possible without provisioning stuff to the user.  The user should be able to use it without installing anything.  This implies it ought to be done using plain javascript.
-encryption functionality must not imply additional server-side infrastructural requirements to f.ex. get a key to a user (sms gateway).  This is nice added functionality, but we must maintain a filesender install that is fully functional with least possible server-side complications
-the encryption key must not be transferred using the same channel as the download link is transferred

It is perfectly acceptable to have this ""power funcionality"" only work in HTml5 fileAPI supporting browsers

Note that as soon as we have this working, we also need to investigate signed javascript: in the scenario where a FileSender server is hacked, end-users need to be able to rely on the integrity of the javascript code used for encryption.

Somethig like 3408.2 MB would do just fine.  

What we'd probably want is something like:

size in MB until it hits 1 GB
size in GB for files > 1 GB

size in MB until the size hits 1 GB.  Two or three numbers precision.

Subject: [filesender-dev] PostgresSQL integer field out of range

Hi,

We encounter the following error for large file sizes in Beta 0.1.2:

  PHP Warning:  pg_query() [<a href='function.pg-query'>function.pg-query</a>]: Query failed: ERROR:  value
""3573778432"" is out of range for type integer in /usr/local/simplesamlphp_1_4/www/filesender/fs_main.php
on line 291

it looks indeed like the type of the filesize column in the database
is plain 32-bits signed ""integer"" on which the PostgresSQL docs say:

  integer       4 bytes usual choice for integer        -2147483648 to +2147483647

Since filesender is meant to facilitate exchange of large files with
positive sizes, I'm sure there exists a better type to suit this
behaviour. According to: http://www.postgresql.org/docs/8.0/interactive/datatype.html#DATATYPE-INT
there's no such thing as an unsigned long, but 

  bigint        8 bytes large-range integer     -9223372036854775808 to 9223372036854775807

might do a better job.

Regards,

Hans.

Guido,

I've just uploaded a file to check out the latest version and (having 
been interrupted while entering the recipient email address) I went 
through the rest of the process, clicked 'Send' and got the message 
'Please select a file to upload'. It took me a little while to work 
out that the problem wasn't that I hadn't selected a file; it was that 
the recipient address was clearly incomplete.
I was impressed that it did test for a valid email address though!
(once I figured out that that's where the problem was.) The incomplete 
address which triggered the error message was:
""david.badger@""
Once I fixed that, it was quite happy to send the file I had 
originally selected. So the error message needs to relate to the field 
causing the error.

Subject: [filesender-dev] LDAP authentication and multiple e-mail address entries in
    ""mail"" attribute

Hello,

Currently I use LDAP authentication/attributes during my tests.
I use my organisation's ldap server, which contains multiple e-mail address entries for
my ""mail"" attribute.
The 1st is my office e-mail address, but the others are aliases for distribution lists
within the organisation.
So, whenever I successfully log in, the ""From""-field is already filled in with all
entries and also stored as such in ""filefrom"" in ""files"" table in db.
As a consequence the receiver of the files gets to see these entries as well, but when
he successfully downloaded the file, then an e-mail is sent to all e-mail entries
(=spam,=confidentiality, =major issue).
So, my suggestion is to make the ""From""-field editable, by which I mean that the
parameter value is parsed and a checklist is created with all found e-mail addresses,
so you can tick off the ones you do/don't want to use (at least one selected) and then
stored as such in the db.
======================================================================

We had similar issues in the Confusa project.  Users can have multiple email addresses.

Options the software should have:
   -take first address
   -give user option to pick from addresses (display multiple addresses with checkboxes in front) but require at least one address

in both options the From: field would need to be editable.

We would need a configuration option indicating which of the two the software would use.

how does that sound?

The email templates are still one language.  This might be a problem we can not solve.  

How do you deal with a Norwegian user sending a file to a Brazilian user?  The Brazilian might not want to receive a Norwegian email.  A Norwegian email with ""english at the bottom"" might also not be desirable.  Letting people set the language of the recipients sounds cumbersome and would be unwieldy with multiple recipients.  

There is no widely deployed mechanism to let an email client pick a locale on behalf of the recipient.  

So this problem appears to be a thorny one: we know who the *sender* is, but have no clue about the receiver.  The user knows but shouldn't be bothered with questions about that and besides, allowing a user to set a certain attribute of a recipient stimulates the next desire: being able to store such information about recipients.  We currently store no permanent information whatsoever and that makes the service very easy to run, which is a characteristic we should think carefully about before giving it up.

It would be really good if the FileSender app has a better sanity check when starting up, and actually reports back.  In the case of a missing log directory, I guess the sane thing to do is to report this through the UI.  So giving some sane feedback where an admin can read it.

Thinking a bit more.  Usually you want all error logging to go to the error log.  There are two things in particular that can not be logged to the error log.

Currently you need to define the filesender installation urls at multiple locations in the config.php file:

	$config['site_url'] = 'http://siteurl/cloudstor/'; // URL to Filesender
	$config['site_simplesamlurl'] = 'http://siteurl/simplesamlphp/';
	$config['site_downloadurl'] = 'http://siteurl/cloudstor/files/';
	$config['site_logouturl'] = 'http://siteurl/cloudstor/logout.php';

I'm not sure why the hostname is required, since filesender could also work with relative links/redirects. The only usecase I could think of is when for example the files are hosted on a different machine/virtualhost. Anyway, it is a good idea to specify the hostname only once, this is less typing and less error prone. I'm not sure what is 'cloudstor' also, I think that is a test machine something that slipped into the release.

It's difficult to ask the person with the problem to tell us what went wrong where, reproduce it etc.  Better it would be to have proper logging.  

To solve this we can implement client-side step-by-step logging that sends a log line to the server for every 'processing step' the client takes.  Server side it would result in one logfile per user.  Preferably with the username in the filename to make debugging for the server admin easy.  The logging would be switched on/off from the server side.  Server side a filter based on ePTID would select for which users logging would be maintained.  That way you wouldn't get too much of logging on a busy server.  

The logging would have to log both the client side steps and the server side steps for that particular user in 1 integrated logfile.

If we have this in the code then even though sometimes things wouldn't work, we at least have a solid handle on where something went wrong.

If you look at how FireFox implements this in their current download progress thingie when I'm downloading a Fedora DVD image:

-it says '2% of 1 file - Downloads""
-FileName

 * Split out config directives into separated files (DB config, location config, etc), this minimizes the chance of change collision
 * Include a complete copy of config.php in the debian package. Problem here is that if config.php is changed the debian version needs to be revised also.

Optinally the error message could also give some hints since there are known cases where this error is reached:

- User has disabled third party cookies in FireFox, hint would be to add
'servername' to the list of exceptions (see #236)
- Upload took more than the session duration time (this probably can be
checked on the server side?), hint would be to either login again and
resume the upload or contact the server admin to increase the session

Would it be possible to add a clause in the config to exclude files/directories from this check? In our setup the files/ directory is a NFS mount on an isilon storage system, and this creates a .snapshot directory, which is mounted read only.

When Filesender loads, it tries and fails to delete this and stops the whole system from working.

As a quick work around I modified line 246 in classes/Functions.php

When I cancel an upload the UI tells me 'Cancelled upload but in the background Gears is still uploading the last started chunk. With a slow uplink and large chunk sizes that can take a while. On the server this last chunk (still in transit) is not yet appended to the tmpfile so when I resume the upload while gears is still uploading the chunk from the previous attempt that could lead to chunks being sent and appended twice.

The scenario would be in that case that while the previous chunk is still in transit Flex asks for the already uploaded filesize *before* the chunk in transit is appended to the tmpfile on the server. That chunk will thus be sent again but since the one still in transit is also appended to the tmpfile the file on the server will get the chunk twice.

Would it be possible to have the 'Cancel upload' function either wait for Gears to actually finish the chunk being uploaded or have Flex somehow 'kill' the Gears-upload ?

I believe we found the reason for this behavior.

In case when filename contains UTF-8 characters field ""fileoriginalname"" 
in the database will be different from the name of file stored on the disc. Because of the discrepancy function cleanUp in cron.php will assume that the file was removed and it will put the file status to Closed. This will be performed in the last loop (""// close all entries that do not have a pyhsical file in storage""). File will not be removed immediately but at the next cron.php run (loop ""// Loop through the files"").

The reason for discrepancy is the following. Field ""fileoriginalname"" 
comes from the JSON feed sent by Flash and the actual name comes from the _FILES variable. In case of JSON feed UTF-8 chars will be changed to \uxxxx equivalents by the json_encode. In case of _FILES variable they will simply be turned to ""_"" by the sanitizeFilename function.

I attached a patch for fs_uploadit.php which turns UTF-8 name from _FILES variable to JSON feed equivalent.

Upload of 2000M (base 1024) file of 2097152000 bytes, upload from a Win7 box with Opera, no gears

At the start of the upload I get on the server:

Oct 29 12:43:33 apache2[11765]: PHP Warning: POST Content-Length of 2097152672 bytes exceeds the limit of 2097152000 bytes in Unknown on line 0

simplesamlphp[11765]: Error: [8] Undefined index: Filedata : /usr/share/filesender/www/fs_uploadit.php [62]
apache2[11765]: Error: [8] Undefined index: fid : /usr/share/filesender/www/fs_uploadit.php [62]
apache2[11765]: Error: [8] Undefined index: Filedata : /usr/share/filesender/www/fs_uploadit.php [62]

After upload the client gets a 'Can not move file' error. It looks like there is no 'tmp' file created on the server. Also note that the Content-Length is 672 bytes larger than the actual filesize of 2097152000. It would be good to catch this error at the start of the upload so users don't have to wait a possibly long time to see that the upload failed.

The advertised limit is 2000M (the post_max_size=2000M limit in PHP.ini):
; Maximum size of POST data that PHP will accept.
post_max_size = 2000M

Setting post_max_size=2001 (and a restart of apache!) makes it possible to upload a 2000M file. This should be in the installation notes (setting post_max_size a little bit larger than the upload_max_filesize to allow for extra header info which is included in the POST Content-Length.

As for the maximum filesize with Flash there are two other relevant variables:

In php.ini:

; Maximum allowed size for uploaded files.
upload_max_filesize = 2000M
i
and in the filesender config.php:

$config['max_flash_upload_size'] = '2147483648'; // 2GB

These should match (but don't in the default config) so the user will be warned when uploading more than the the minimum of the two settings. We could explain this in the installation notes or perhaps it is possible to add a check on the (three!) relevant variables and only allow uploads that are less than or equal to the minimum of the three settings (taking into account that the post_max_size should allow for some extra bytes, say a few K).

Either way, the current defaults and installation notes are not consistent and will give problems with flash uploads around and above the 2000M (base 1024). ",2011-01-29,,,false,2510 days,2420 days,,2510 days,,,,

We need to test the various cases where people could use non-ASCII characters:

- selected filename
- message subject
- message text

and those for both flash and gears upload *and* subsequent download (the download of a gears uploaded file currently fails with invalid voucher).

How to repeat: start a download of a large file taking a long time. Then try (while the file is downloading) with the same browser to do other actions with filesender (on the same server). They will give you blank screens *until* the download is finished or cancelled.

Hi,

Is is possible to implement some sort of email address validation? Users input all kind of bad
email address syntax like:

'my.email@domain.com'
""my.email@domain.com""
name surname <my.email@domain.com>
<my.email@domain.com>

Filesender expects email address in the my.email@domain.com form, so all of the above are
undeliverable email addresses.

Some sort of regex check like this should be enough:

\b[A-Z0-9._%-]+@[A-Z0-9.-]+\.[A-Z]{2,4}\b

Nikola

The file is however correctly downloaded and usable.  

The ""Content-Dispositon"" problem

At the moment the labeling of a string as UTF-8 encoded is not done when a file containing special characters is downloaded. The download process uses the HTTP Content-Disposition header with a filename parameter. This header is only defined for filenames containing characters from the (single byte) ISO-8859-1 character set.

Although there are currently ongoing standardisation efforts to make it possible to use other character sets there is no universally adopted way of transmitting a UTF-8 encoded filename yet (see http://greenbytes.de/tech/webdav/draft-ietf-httpbis-content-disp-latest.html for details). The current filesender code therefore relies on what is called 'encoding sniffing' in browsers such as FireFox, Chrome and Safari. Internet Explorer can only handle ISO-8859-1 (single byte) encoded filenames.

This should warn users that logging out of one specific service doesn't terminate other sessions one might have to other services and also doesn't clear the 'main' session with the identity provider of the user. This makes it possible to login again to FileSender without being asked for credentials. We might want to add a warning about this to the FileSender logout page.

The (a bit technical) text from the SURFet IdP as example:
-------------
Due to the nature of this centralized authentication infrastructure and the type of sessions that you have running, it not possible to terminate all of your sessions with each Service Provider with 100% certainty. There is only one option for guaranteed secure logout:

Shutdown your browser when you want to end your running sessions in a secure way!

Apologies for the inconvenience: this is a strong security advice.

Suggestion from Wendy: ""Your logout from FileSender is complete. To ensure you have also been logged out from  your institutional identity provider, please quit your browser.""

392,Allow uploader to disable download receipt email to file *recipient*,Suggested features,Jan Meijer (dPS9kyuyur3zYrab7jnrAJ),Jan Meijer,dPS9kyuyur3zYrab7jnrAJ,Normal,New,Not Completed,,2011-04-27,0.0,FileSender,0.0,0.0,0.0,-,0.0,0.0,"The concrete use case that triggered this is when someone sends a large file to a mailing list.  The receipt email ""person X has downloaded file Y"" is sent *to* the uploader with a Cc: to the *downloader/recipient*.  If the recipient is an email list, the Cc: will go to the email list for every download.  If you distribute a file to a list with several 100 people, that is a bit .. annoying.

The difficulty here is to cater for use cases like this without complicating the user interface.  A solution might be to have different ""filesender user views"" depending on which ""persona"" you are.  Using personas is a common technique in user interaction design.  You define a limited number of persons with certain characteristics as the people you imagine will use the software and cater to their needs.  

For FileSender this might be: a first time user, someone who uses the functionality ""as is"" and someone who considers him/herself as a ""power user"" and wants to be able to tweak more of the experience.  The first time user would for example have access to a more ""guided"" approach, a ""as is"" user knows how to use FileSender but needs no advanced functionality nor does he want to be bothered with the ""guided use"".   The power user would have the option to switch stuff on and off.

This would lead to 3 views on the functionality.  

I am tempted to think we need to go that way, as we also need to figure out how to incorporate for example time stamping in the UI.

This requires more thought and more speccing, but at least it is a ticket now....

One of them came with the question whether it was possible, in MyFiles, to extend the expiry time of a file.  Say you sent a file to someone, that someone turned out to be on holiday, then you might want to extend the expiry time.

Thoughts: treat this in the way libraries do?  Allow for one (or more, such to be configurable) extension of the expiry date, presumably using a button ""extend file availability period"".  Easiest would be if you would have a standard ""file availability extension"" period.  That would be server-configurable as well, and presumably one week would be a good default.  However, you can see coming that people would want to just pick a particular date: ""I *know* the person will be back on that and that date, so that date + 1 week is good.""

This then implies both a button ""extend"" which does a standard extension plus a calendar which allows a user to set a more specific date.  The date box would need to be there anyway to show when the file is about to expire.  Having said that, there still ought to be a max expire, also on ""extension of availability"".  By far the easiest way to get started with this appears to be a simple button ""extend availability"" that simply extends availability with a configurable standard amount of time/days and not let the user pick something.

What I imagine is that a first time user can have some ""first use assistance"" in the form of for example a little youtube video showing them how FileSender works (in their own language), and possibly a big help button.  Something like that.  

But this is UI clutter for those people who know quite well how to use it.  So hence this ticket: I would like to make it possible that a first time user gets a slightly different UI experience then a second time user.  This mechanism can be generalised to offer different groups different ""help"".

I would like to strongly suggest to change the official installation [1] manuals to NOT include generating of a self-signed certificate since Flash only works with self-signed certificates in Internet Explorer and results in famous Flash 2038 IO Error when trying to upload a file using all non-IE browsers (both Linux and Windows). It seems to be a Flash issue [2], but it is rather hard to figure it out from very generic ""#2038 IO Error"" message code.
I know that the instructions say: ""Be sure to get a real certificate since filesender won't work with snakeoil certificates."" but if  these steps are not valid and must be replaced (with fairly different steps), why to include them in the first place?

We have spent a considerable amount of time to track this down so it maybe worth to include the ""2038 error"" in the related FAQ [3] for people getting the error not realizing it works with http.

Problem: the current Norwegian language file contains the right norwegian characters in for example ""logg på"".  These are displayed as garbage though.  See attached screenshot.

2. I suggest to rename the ""upload"" button to ""Send"", make it *big* and reposition it.  Right now it sits right next to the ""Browse"" button.  However, the steps a user has to take go from top to bottom.  To me it makes more sense to have the ""Send"" button as the last thing to do in a flow that goes from top to bottom.  It needs to big to make sure a user doesn't have to use more effort then needed to both see the button and click on it.

3. Right now, you have a label ""select a file"", followed by a text box followed by a browse button.  Upon selecting a file, the name and size are displayed underneath that textbox.  It would make more sense to start with a label ""Selected file"" followed by an empty field followed by a ""Select a file"" or ""Browse for a file"" button.  The name would then appear in the empty field, the size underneath, and -if possible- the date the file was last changed if that is an attribute that can be asked for.  The text boxes should be un-editable.

If such a service could work for us it presumably gives us:
- an opportunity to scale testing to many more browsers without incurring an increase in time use
- an opportunity to let anyone run tests once tests have been defined.  This opens up for including running defined end user workflow tests in the development of new features /fixing of bugs: development is ready once the existing tests succeed

https://saucelabs.com/resources

Create a test account at Sauce Labs, take one feature from FileSender 2.0, for example the ""drag and drop file selection"" feature, and try to create a Sauce Labs test for this.  From their feature list they should have PHP bindings, I would think it would be most convenient for the FileSender project to define its Selenium-server tests in PHP.  The Sauce Labs web site has plenty of documentation to get you started :)  Sauce Labs allows to import Selenium IDE scripts, which may be useful.  Would be convenient to know if there is an effort difference between importing IDE created scripts and writing tests in code.

it looks to me like the particular circumstance (file select returning an empty file descriptor) is unlikely to occur but still, it would be good to have a language tag there :)  I would have had a go at it were it not that I don't exactly know *when* you'd actually end up in that piece of code.  Would be good to include that in the code comments, what circumstances trigger that particular error.

Similar message sent to simplesaml list:

Filesender has a version number hhidden away in www/index.php.
Attached is a patch that moves it to a constant, and add a compare function.

As explain on the simplesaml list, this patch is useful mostly for
integration with other apps.
Would be best if it got applied to older versions too.

This is a common case when using SSP (not only with FileSender) and I'm not sure if it is fixable or where it should be 'fixed'. A few posibilities to handle this:

- Disable the Back button (if possible but even when it is possible it looks intrusive/confusing to do that)
- Leave it as is and make a FAQ entry
- Do a 'redirect' from the/a first FileSender landing page to the 'New Upload' page so that when people do use the Back button they go back to a FileSender page and not a SSP page ?

FYI: at SURFnet I almost get no support questions (it does seem to work without questions for most people) except for the occasional error report about this one. Jan also got them at UNINETT. My standard reply (""Don't use the Back button"") somehow doesn't feel good ;-) It does happen in 1.0/1,1 but also in 1.5 if you never leave the New Upload page.",2012-03-01,,,false,2157 days,2023 days,,,,1.0,remains a known defficiency in 1.5,

Downloads using Chrome on Win7 *without SP1 or the relevant hotfix* are seemingly OK (no error message) but are incomplete (way too small). Applying a MS Hotfix *or* updating to Win7 SP1 appears to fix the problem. 

Even then there is the issue that Win7 still seems to be silent about filled disks :( 

Another strange thing is that the Win7 Resource Monitor seems to have a problem measuring the network load when uploading with Chrome. It reports something like 500Kbps when the actual
upload performance was more like 30 Mbps or more.


The bug is more or less mentioned/described in http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=21055 (comments 56 and 57 are relevant).

Maybe we should drop the auto clear and make it very easy for a user to clear the form.  In a way that's already there, they can press ""new upload"".  So rather than auto-clear, maybe ask on cancel a question of the type ""clear form, select new file or quit""?

601,HTML5 (or Gears) upload with a backslash or double quote in the filename fails,Bugs in version 1.1,Xander Jansen (bkpnJ4jEWr37jceJe5afGb),Xander Jansen,bkpnJ4jEWr37jceJe5afGb,Normal,Fixed,2012-06-03,,2011-11-26,0.0,FileSender,0.0,0.0,0.0,-,0.0,0.0,"With 1.1 using HTML5 and also with 1.0.1 using Gears uploads of a file containg a \ in the filename fails after upload. User gets a 'Cannot move file' popup and on the backend a ""Cannot find File in Temp Folder"" is logged in the administrator Error logs (accesible from the UI).

This is caused by the way the filename is passed on to the backend on two different
occasions in two different ways. 

During the upload (of each chunk) the filename is passed through a POST/GET and the \ gets escaped (say hi to the magic quotes :():

    [n] => back\\slash.jpg

After the upload when the file is moved from temp storage to final storage the filename is sent in a json-encoded block and the \ is not escaped:

   [fileoriginalname] => back\slash.jpg

Since the filename is used for generating a hashed temporary filename on the backend there will be a *different* tempfilename on both occasions and the move will fail.

A structural solution would be to use the same method on both occasions to pass the filename from UI to backend (so any escaping/encoding/etc will be the same) or use one moment in the workflow to generate the tempfilename and use the result on all occasions where the tempfilename is needed.

Workarounds for this case could be:

- put the \ on the list of invalid characters in the filename (function fnCheckString in the flex source in two src files) Needs careful checking on Windows where the \ has a special meaning.
- use stripslashes on the input during uploads: this might work but is highly dependent on the 'magic quotes' mess we all learned to love and will definitely introduce complications
- turn of magic quotes ? (needs testing and sanity checking)

Note that this will be taken care of in 1.5 in a structural way, see #405

The original motivation for doing it this way was practical: we couldn't do direct downloads with the technology choices we'd made.  However, this reason is no longer there.

In addition, back in the filesender prototyping days in 2008, I remember reasoning that a user ought to have both options: a direct download-link in the email, clicking on which resulted in the file downloading (and possibly opening in the right application), with in additoin a ""click here to learn more about your file before downloading it"" anti-phishing link.

We ended up with *only* the anti-phishing option, out of necessity.  Now that it is no longer needed, we should revisit this and make it easier.

This ties in with a request I've seen for a ""direct download link"" to allow tools like wget, curl to download a file directly (automating workflow!).  Another good reason to do this is complaints I got from a number of users: the click on the link but the file doesn't open in <relevant app>.  So there is a group of users to whom it is more natural to click and see the file open.  I suggest we make this happen.

Implement real time feedback to the user through the UI on upload/download performance and feedback on that performance relative to what others get.

If we can tell a user ""the average person got 80Mbps upload and 83 Mbps download, and here is what you just got/are getting"" that would help both the user and
the site.

The user has the benefit of knowing whether he's within the reasonable upload/downloadspeed band or whether there is something that might need attention.

The site has the benefit of both marketing a high speed high quality network ""upload through your NREN and life is good"", and enabling a user to figure out
whether the problem is their bandwidth/desktop or whether there might be a service issue.


Blue sky dream: something a-la SURFnet-Detective for FileSender specific. Give users real time feedback on upload/download performance, and on said performance
compared to other users.  In addition, allow them to do a pre-upload check on performance.  AdobeConnect does this, as do many DDoS clients.  That pre-upload
check might then include other checks, a sort of ""can I do FileSender and how fast can I do it"" check.  Lastly would be great to include some way to help users
diagnose possible problems.

Now this looks remarkably like the SURFnet detective but then FileSender specific.

It would require stuff in the UI.  Where we'd put it is probably clear when we've sorted out the ""where do we put advanced functionality without cluttering the
basic functionality"" question.  In addition there is backend code that needs to be written.

Main deviation being the use of lower/upper case of language and country tags. To prevent confusion we should go to the following filename naming scheme:

<language>_<COUNTRY>

<language> is the shortest two/three letter ISO 639 language code in lowercase
<COUNTRY> (or better perhaps <REGION>) is the ISO 3166-1 country/region/territory code in UPPERcase

Use of ""_"" (underscore) in filenames follows the convention for defining 'locales' on modern Linux/Unix systems (and defined/allowd by the related Unicode/ICU definitions, see [[url:http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr35/#Unicode_Language_and_Locale_Identifiers|http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr35/#Unicode_Language_and_Locale_Identifiers]] )

Note that browser tags for language preference use the ""-"" hyphen (as defined in BCP 47)

Changing this in beta2 has two advantages:
1) use of well used standard for naming locales (for filenames).
2) no mix-up with 'old-style' language definitions in ./config (see related ticket #657)

Re 2) Since we decided to move the distribution provided './config' language definitions to the main files in ./language', left-overs in '/.config' should not be used anymore unless they cotain local modifications. A side effect of renaming all language files now will be that the 'left-overs' in './config' won't be used anymore so the actual (and possibly changed) definitions in the './language' dir will always be used. pre-beta2 users can be directed to move local customisations (and only those) to a file according to the 'new' scheme.

Chris and I were discussing upload speed for chunked (html5) upload and where there might be options for improvement.  I looked at http 1.1 keep_alive this week and didn't really see a difference in with or without.  Chris suggested to look at the bit where the chunks are actually written to the temp file.
Around line 247 in www/fs_upload.php there's this code:

while( $data = fread( $fd,  1000000  ) ) file_put_contents( $config[""site_filestore""].sanitizeFilename($tempFilename).checkFileSize($uploadfolder.$tempFilename).""tmp"", $data ) or die(""Error"");
 
It effectively ""chunks the chunk"".  It looked like changing that line to:

file_put_contents( $config[""site_filestore""].sanitizeFilename($tempFilename), $fd, FILE_APPEND ) or die(""Error"");

made for an interesting performance difference.  Chris will look at whether there was a good reason to use the while loop.

have an URL that he can feed to wget to download the ISO straight to the right 
server, not first download to his workstation only to upload it again to the 
server over ADSL.

It can be assumed that in many cases where receiving huge files, you want to 
use them in a context which is not your local workstation.

The fix turned out rather simple: the Start Download button uses JavaScript 
document.location to start the download. However, there's no need for this 
(anymore). Therefore, I've moved the download URL from the JavaScript into the 
href attribute. The onClick remains to display the informational message. 
Users that know how to use wget will know how to right-click on the Start 
Download button and copy the URL that they need.""
