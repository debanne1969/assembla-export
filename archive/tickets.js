As a project we have had a change in lead developer and release manager between version 1.6 and 2.0.   The external environment has changed as well: for certain tasks there are now cloud services we can leverage (language crowd sourcing), certain other components we so far used are no longer available (OpenIdP for test accounts).  \r\n\r\nAs the FileSender effort matures, we need to rethink certain processes (project management, development, QA, release management, support) as well as more explicit documentation to ensure tasks can be more easily transferred to new contributors and to ensure the project's maturity level is on par with what the community needs and expects.\r\n\r\nIn addition we are currently suffering from administrative backlog.  After 4 major releases and several prototype exercises we have a significant number of open tickets, possibly outdated wiki pages etc. obstructing a good view of the current project reality.

The server should never see plaintext data.  If this is not viable, server-side encryption can be considered to improve \"at rest\" protection.  Note that the effects are different though:\n\n* Client-side: data is *never* plain text on the server: a server hack would have no influence (provided the javascript served to users isn't changed ;)\n\n* Server-side: data is plain-text on the server until encrypted *after* upload, and plaintext after decryption before download\n\n\nImportant constraints:\n-encryption functionality must be possible without provisioning stuff to the user.  The user should be able to use it without installing anything.  This implies it ought to be done using plain javascript.\n-encryption functionality must not imply additional server-side infrastructural requirements to f.ex. get a key to a user (sms gateway).  This is nice added functionality, but we must maintain a filesender install that is fully functional with least possible server-side complications\n-the encryption key must not be transferred using the same channel as the download link is transferred\n\nIt is perfectly acceptable to have this \"power funcionality\" only work in HTml5 fileAPI supporting browsers\n\nNote that as soon as we have this working, we also need to investigate signed javascript: in the scenario where a FileSender server is hacked, end-users need to be able to rely on the integrity of the javascript code used for encryption.

The Brazilian might not want to receive a Norwegian email.  A Norwegian email with \"english at the bottom\" might also not be desirable.  Letting people set the language of the recipients sounds cumbersome and would be unwieldy with multiple recipients.  \n\nThere is no widely deployed mechanism to let an email client pick a locale on behalf of the recipient.  \n\nSo this problem appears to be a thorny one: we know who the *sender* is, but have no clue about the receiver.  The user knows but shouldn't be bothered with questions about that and besides, allowing a user to set a certain attribute of a recipient stimulates the next desire: being able to store such information about recipients.  We currently store no permanent information whatsoever and that makes the service very easy to run, which is a characteristic we should think carefully about before giving it up.\n\n","2010-03-19T12:13:21.000+00:00","2012-02-07T17:18:05.000+00:00",114011,null,"dPS9kyuyur3zYrab7jnrAJ,aNSALiyQSr3482eJe5cbCb",null,0.0,0,139.0,0,0,28660,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,null,null]

It's difficult to ask the person with the problem to tell us what went wrong where, reproduce it etc.  Better it would be to have proper logging.  \n\nTo solve this we can implement client-side step-by-step logging that sends a log line to the server for every 'processing step' the client takes.  Server side it would result in one logfile per user.  Preferably with the username in the filename to make debugging for the server admin easy.  The logging would be switched on/off from the server side.  Server side a filter based on ePTID would select for which users logging would be maintained.  That way you wouldn't get too much of logging on a busy server.  \n\nThe logging would have to log both the client side steps and the server side steps for that particular user in 1 integrated logfile.\n\nIf we have this in the code then even though sometimes things wouldn't work, we at least have a solid handle on where something went wrong.   \n\n\n\n\n\n\nDifferent combinations of operating system (version) - browser (version)  - flash version have different results and it's difficult to pinpoint exactly what piece of code was responsible for stuff going wrong.  \n\nTo solve this functionality needs to be imp","2010-07-05T13:49:31.000+00:00","2011-01-29T12:01:56.000+00:00",345073,null,"dPS9kyuyur3zYrab7jnrAJ,aNSALiyQSr3482eJe5cbCb","2010-10-14T12:35:56.000+00:00",0.0,0,246.0,0,0,447388,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,null,null]

I am refering to version 1.16.1.\n\nI believe we found the reason for this behavior.\n\nIn case when filename contains UTF-8 characters field \"fileoriginalname\" \nin the database will be different from the name of file stored on the disc. Because of the discrepancy function cleanUp in cron.php will assume that the file was removed and it will put the file status to Closed. This will be performed in the last loop (\"// close all entries that do not have a pyhsical file in storage\"). File will not be removed immediately but at the next cron.php run (loop \"// Loop through the files\").\n\nThe reason for discrepancy is the following. Field \"fileoriginalname\" \ncomes from the JSON feed sent by Flash and the actual name comes from the _FILES variable. In case of JSON feed UTF-8 chars will be changed to \\uxxxx equivalents by the json_encode. In case of _FILES variable they will simply be turned to \"_\" by the sanitizeFilename function.\n\nI attached a patch for fs_uploadit.php which turns UTF-8 name from _FILES variable to JSON feed equivalent.\n\nCheers,\nemir","2010-10-31T00:17:22.000+00:00","2016-12-12T19:43:49.000+00:00",345073,null,",aNSALiyQSr3482eJe5cbCb","2010-11-17T23:56:50.000+00:00",0.0,0,321.0,0,0,447388,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,null,null]

It looks like there is no 'tmp' file created on the server. Also note that the Content-Length is 672 bytes larger than the actual filesize of 2097152000. It would be good to catch this error at the start of the upload so users don't have to wait a possibly long time to see that the upload failed.\n\nThe advertised limit is 2000M (the post_max_size=2000M limit in PHP.ini):\n; Maximum size of POST data that PHP will accept.\npost_max_size = 2000M\n\nSetting post_max_size=2001 (and a restart of apache!) makes it possible to upload a 2000M file. This should be in the installation notes (setting post_max_size a little bit larger than the upload_max_filesize to allow for extra header info which is included in the POST Content-Length.\n\nAs for the maximum filesize with Flash there are two other relevant variables:\n\nIn php.ini:\n\n; Maximum allowed size for uploaded files.\nupload_max_filesize = 2000M\ni\nand in the filesender config.php:\n\n$config['max_flash_upload_size'] = '2147483648'; // 2GB\n\nThese should match (but don't in the default config) so the user will be warned when uploading more than the the minimum of the two settings. We could explain this in the installation notes or perhaps it is possible to add a check on the (three!) relevant variables and only allow uploads that are less than or equal to the minimum of the three settings (taking into account that the post_max_size should allow for some extra bytes, say a few K).\n\nEither way, the current defaults and installation notes are not consistent and will give problems with flash uploads around and above the 2000M (base 1024).

You define a limited number of persons with certain characteristics as the people you imagine will use the software and cater to their needs.  \n\nFor FileSender this might be: a first time user, someone who uses the functionality \"as is\" and someone who considers him/herself as a \"power user\" and wants to be able to tweak more of the experience.  The first time user would for example have access to a more \"guided\" approach, a \"as is\" user knows how to use FileSender but needs no advanced functionality nor does he want to be bothered with the \"guided use\".   The power user would have the option to switch stuff on and off.\n\nThis would lead to 3 views on the functionality.  \n\nI am tempted to think we need to go that way, as we also need to figure out how to incorporate for example time stamping in the UI.\n\nThis requires more thought and more speccing, but at least it is a ticket now....\n","2011-04-27T10:52:19.000+00:00","2011-04-27T10:52:19.000+00:00",114011,null,"dPS9kyuyur3zYrab7jnrAJ,aNSALiyQSr3482eJe5cbCb,b8-41KDuKr344jeJe5cbLA",null,0.0,0,392.0,0,0,28660,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,null,null]

One of them came with the question whether it was possible, in MyFiles, to extend the expiry time of a file.  Say you sent a file to someone, that someone turned out to be on holiday, then you might want to extend the expiry time.\n\nThoughts: treat this in the way libraries do?  Allow for one (or more, such to be configurable) extension of the expiry date, presumably using a button \"extend file availability period\".  Easiest would be if you would have a standard \"file availability extension\" period.  That would be server-configurable as well, and presumably one week would be a good default.  However, you can see coming that people would want to just pick a particular date: \"I *know* the person will be back on that and that date, so that date + 1 week is good.\"\n\nThis then implies both a button \"extend\" which does a standard extension plus a calendar which allows a user to set a more specific date.  The date box would need to be there anyway to show when the file is about to expire.  Having said that, there still ought to be a max expire, also on \"extension of availability\".  By far the easiest way to get started with this appears to be a simple button \"extend availability\" that simply extends availability with a configurable standard amount of time/days and not let the user pick something.\n\n","2011-05-05T07:38:55.000+00:00","2011-05-05T07:38:55.000+00:00",114011,null,"dPS9kyuyur3zYrab7jnrAJ,aNSALiyQSr3482eJe5cbCb,b8-41KDuKr344jeJe5cbLA",null,0.0,0,398.0,0,0,28660,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,null,null]

Something like that.  \n\nBut this is UI clutter for those people who know quite well how to use it.

So upload went fine, move went fine, email was sent out, download screen popped up, but download went bad.  Nothing significant in the logging.\n\nAfter observing what goes on on our system I made these observations: observations:\n \n1. on our install the php temp upload directory is set to /tmp rather then to /data/filesender/tmp\n2. our FileSender files directory is /data/filesender/files\n3. /tmp and /files are on different partitions.  That means that a move is an actual transfer, rather then just flipping a pointer in an inode.\n4. our cleanup (expiry) cronjob ran every 5 minutes\n \nThis means the move from temp dir to filesender files dir takes time. With an 1.5 GB file this might intersect with the cronjob running.  If I read the cronjob's code correctly, it checks for files that do exist in the filestore but do not have a database entry associated with them.  If it founds such files, it deletes them.

The original motivation for doing it this way was practical: we couldn't do direct downloads with the technology choices we'd made.  However, this reason is no longer there.\n\nIn addition, back in the filesender prototyping days in 2008, I remember reasoning that a user ought to have both options: a direct download-link in the email, clicking on which resulted in the file downloading (and possibly opening in the right application), with in additoin a \"click here to learn more about your file before downloading it\" anti-phishing link.\n\nWe ended up with *only* the anti-phishing option, out of necessity.  Now that it is no longer needed, we should revisit this and make it easier.\n\nThis ties in with a request I've seen for a \"direct download link\" to allow tools like wget, curl to download a file directly (automating workflow!).  Another good reason to do this is complaints I got from a number of users: the click on the link but the file doesn't open in <relevant app>.  So there is a group of users to whom it is more natural to click and see the file open.  I suggest we make this happen.\n\nIt probably involves some fiddling with sending the right  mime-type as well I'd guess.","2012-01-19T15:59:32.000+00:00","2012-01-19T15:59:32.000+00:00",114011,null,"dPS9kyuyur3zYrab7jnrAJ,aNSALiyQSr3482eJe5cbCb,b8-41KDuKr344jeJe5cbLA",null,0.0,0,627.0,0,1,28660,1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,null,null]

Main deviation being the use of lower/upper case of language and country tags. To prevent confusion we should go to the following filename naming scheme:\n\n<language>_<COUNTRY>\n\n<language> is the shortest two/three letter ISO 639 language code in lowercase\n<COUNTRY> (or better perhaps <REGION>) is the ISO 3166-1 country/region/territory code in UPPERcase\n\nUse of \"_\" (underscore) in filenames follows the convention for defining 'locales' on modern Linux/Unix systems (and defined/allowd by the related Unicode/ICU definitions, see [[url:http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr35/#Unicode_Language_and_Locale_Identifiers|http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr35/#Unicode_Language_and_Locale_Identifiers]] )\n\nNote that browser tags for language preference use the \"-\" hyphen (as defined in BCP 47)\n\nChanging this in beta2 has two advantages:\n1) use of well used standard for naming locales (for filenames).\n2) no mix-up with 'old-style' language definitions in ./config (see related ticket #657)\n\nRe 2) Since we decided to move the distribution provided './config' language definitions to the main files in ./language', left-overs in '/.config' should not be used anymore unless they cotain local modifications. A side effect of renaming all language files now will be that the 'left-overs' in './config' won't be used anymore so the actual (and possibly changed) definitions in the './language' dir will always be used. pre-beta2 users can be directed to move local customisations (and only those) to a file according to the 'new' scheme.\n\n","2012-03-19T09:28:57.000+00:00","2012-08-30T16:04:56.000+00:00",394418,null,"bkpnJ4jEWr37jceJe5afGb,aNSALiyQSr3482eJe5cbCb,b8-41KDuKr344jeJe5cbLA","2012-04-25T10:32:54.000+00:00",0.0,0,677.0,0,1,447388,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,null,null]

This tries to combat the effect of filesender's filestore becoming a goldmine of assorted documents that would be easy to recover - somewhat like the infamous printer hard drives.\n\nAttached patch implements this. The wiping happens at night, so I think usually it will not matter much that it takes a little bit longer than unlinking. I did add a configurable option for it, for sites that don't want this functionality; the default is set to true now because I reasoned that it normally doesn't hurt, and there will probably only be a few sites for which it's necessary to turn it off.

He \nreceives an ISO via filesender from which he wants to boot a virtual machine. \nWith current filesender the user is not provided with an URL to download the \nISO directly, only one that works with JavaScript only. He wants to be able to \nhave an URL that he can feed to wget to download the ISO straight to the right \nserver, not first download to his workstation only to upload it again to the \nserver over ADSL.\n\nIt can be assumed that in many cases where receiving huge files, you want to \nuse them in a context which is not your local workstation.\n\nThe fix turned out rather simple: the Start Download button uses JavaScript \ndocument.location to start the download. However, there's no need for this \n(anymore). Therefore, I've moved the download URL from the JavaScript into the \nhref attribute. The onClick remains to display the informational message. \nUsers that know how to use wget will know how to right-click on the Start \nDownload button and copy the URL that they need.\"\n","2012-04-05T08:13:19.000+00:00","2012-05-09T20:50:30.000+00:00",394418,null,"bkpnJ4jEWr37jceJe5afGb,aNSALiyQSr3482eJe5cbCb,b8-41KDuKr344jeJe5cbLA","2012-05-09T20:50:29.000+00:00",0.0,0,708.0,0,1,447388,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,null,null]

So all we need is:\n-to display the ip address next to the download date, show ipv4 or ipv6 address \n-implement a config.php switch \"show download user ip address in myfiles\" to either show or not show download ip addresses in MyFiles\n\nWe'll start with IP address, but would be good to have a look at whether resolving the ip address makes sense.  It is a bit tricky, as we don't store the resolving  result in the database, so would mean \"live\" resolving resulting in possible slower display of MyFiles, not preferable.

This is unfortunate as the IdP controls when that session times out.  Experience from the Norwegian install show that uploads lasting longer than 8 hours suffer from session timeout at the IdP: the Norwegian identity federation IdP has a timeout after 8 hours.\n\nThere are several factors in SimpleSAMLphp that the SP controls but one it doesn't:  SessionNotOnOrAfter is sent in the SAML response from IdP to SP.  Olav Morken writes:\n\n\" It is also sent from the IdP to the SP, in the\n      \"SessionNotOnOrAfter\" attribute. The SP is supposed to use this\n      to determine when the session expires. In practice, this means\n      that the IdP can force the SP to reauthenticate more often than\n      whatever the SP has set in 'session.duration'. \"\n\nhttps://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#!topic/simplesamlphp/ERlbkoFpntw\n\nIt's the SessionNotOnOrAfter that bites us.  The implication is that when a FileSender upload lasts longer than SessionNotOnOrAfter ( 8 hours in Norway) the user gets a \"you're no longer authenticated\" message.  \n\nA solution is to change how FileSender deals with this: define a FileSender valid upload session, that remains valid for as long as an upload runs.  Only *after* the upload is completed will the IdP be asked again whether the user still has a valid session.  This means an upload will complete and should the user want to upload another file, a new session needs to be established if the old one has expired.\n\nA big advantage with pulling control over upload session validity into FileSender.  Xander reports this should not be too complicated.\n\nXander's list of points of consideration:\n- be aware of session hijacking etc.  The \"FileSender valid upload session\" should only be valid for a specific browser/client upload that started after normal authentication.  Probably a combination of sessionId and unique upload token (something we already have?)\n- such an upload token needs its own expiry, e.g. if 15 minutes without a new chunk then lose validity as AuthN token\n- what to do with the combination uploadcomplete and timedout SSP-session?  We need to present \"your upload has completed\" page.\n\nxander, please check the description and modify where needed.","2013-04-29T06:54:39.000+00:00","2016-02-25T09:06:12.000+00:00",6605143,null,"dPS9kyuyur3zYrab7jnrAJ,bkpnJ4jEWr37jceJe5afGb,dgRDGuZ4ar478MacwqEsg8","2015-03-27T16:56:05.000+00:00",0.0,0,-1.0,0,0,447388,0,1.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,"2015-03-27T16:56:05.000+00:00",null]

Users should be warned after choosing 'suspend' of how it works and the steps required to come back to this transaction. This should be paired with functionality which tells users they have a pending upload transaction and should continue to ask them if they wish to either continue with the upload or cancel it. \nThis will only work when the user uses the same browser&computer combination to resume the upload.\nSome way, for example via a button/dropdown list/dialog for the user to access a list of their suspended transactions. This stops the user from having to repopulate the list themselves and would essentially make the uploads page re-appear how they left if (any file uploads complete in that transaction would still be there with complete progress bars). Suspended transactions should have some form of expiration date. Requires validations/error checks to ensure the pending files still exist on disk.\n\nCancel should forfeit the transaction and stop *all* files (both those already finished and those in the queue).

Following well established engineering principles \"what isn't there can't be abused\" FileSender ought to be optimised to minimise the data privacy footprint of its users.  This also minimises possible exposure in case a FileSender instance should be compromised.  \n\nThis means logging least possible, by default deleting possibly sensitive logging in a timely fashion and in general ensure FileSender admins don't have (easy) access to privacy sensitive information.  It also means deleting privacy sensitive entries from the database, either by anonimising the privacy sensitive bits (like we did in the stats module) or by deleting them.\n\nIn particular we need to remove data that details communication meta-data: who sends what to whom.  It's probably OK to have such an overview on the institutional/domain level, but not on personal level.  When should it be purged?  After expire of the file/transaction or based on a time limit?  What about the audit trail?  Once purged, the audit trail disappears.  How does this work with the database being backup-ed?  What about sending the audit trail as an email to the sender?  What about making an \"incognito\" transaction? \n\nA number of FileSender features depend on having historical data available:\n-auto-complete in the To: field\n-the audit trail for a sender of a file, especially in the cases where the user chose to not receive emails of the file downloads\n-other?\n\nThe audit trail might be an important one, with anecdotal evidence and logging suggesting a number of users use FileSender in particular for the email receipts.  A straight forward solution is to simply gather the audit trail in an email and send it to the sender of the file on purge of the record.  That way the audit trail is where it belongs (transaction owner) and it's not with us.\n\nWe need to think this through carefully but do need to address it in our 2.0 release.

Confirmed on UNINETT and DeIC 2.0 test install.  Symptom: just nothing happens and nothing is logged.\n\nSet the number of workers to 16 and it also works with FireFox.\n\nEtienne provides following feedback:\n\nThe mechanism in a terasender upload is as follows:\n- a worker requests a job with the terasender job driver\n- the job driver locks (sets boolean in itself) so it doesn't respond to multiple workers.  If another worker tries to access it it tells the other worker to wait.  This ensures no chunk is given to two workers.\n- the driver gives a worker an answer; either \"here is a chunk for you\" or \"nothing more to do\".\n\nif this messaging mechanism breaks down nothing will work.\n\nThoughts:\n- maybe past a certain number of workers with each worker waiting for .5 seconds, with a lot of workers it may be just waiting?\n- maybe there's some overflow in the messaging system in FireFox?\n- upon checking the upload console: every worker is requesting a job.  First worker is given file, other worker gets “nothing to do” as a response.  Are expected to close.  First worker doesn’t even signal worker is complete.  Past specific number of workers the browser starts to handle events in a bad way.\n-Is the bug related to max number of workers or to large number of workers combined with async uplods?\n-what is the breaking number?  \n-maybe there is a limit in the global amount of “work” FireFox can do?  That Safari and Chrome doesn’t have?  Does messaging just break down?\n\nEtienne will take following actions:\n- test to see if there is a specific fixed breaking point in # webworkers\n- check Mozilla email list for similar issues and write email asking others if they've seen similar things\n- post on Stack overflow\n\nThis is not a high priority issue at the moment: just don't set the #webworkers to 30 does the trick.  But we need to figure out what causes this.  If it's a firefox bug it should be fixed.  If it is some issue in our code it should be fixed.  \n\nFor the 2.0-alpha we will -unless we find out what causes it- label this as a known issue for now.","2015-02-11T11:38:38.000+00:00","2015-02-11T11:38:38.000+00:00",6605143,null,"dPS9kyuyur3zYrab7jnrAJ,dgRDGuZ4ar478MacwqEsg8",null,0.0,0,-12.0,0,0,28660,1,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,"2015-02-11T11:38:38.000+00:00",null]

The reviewd 2.0 codebase uses uniq_id and mt_rand.  Both don't return a sufficiently secure random number which may result in an attacker guessing the state of the random generator.  An attacker might thus be able to guess download URLs and CSRF tokens.  Recommend to use secure random generator.\n\n*Assessment:* Issue confirmed and needs to be addressed before the 2.0 release.  Preferably without using openssl as it would add a dependency and be about 100 times (ballpark figure)  slower than using the other random generator.\n\nThe unique identifiers used in FileSender need to have two characteristics:\n•\tthe ID must be unique\n•\tthe ID must be non-guessable.  As long as you can't guess the random number in the ID you can't guess the random generator state.  \n\nFor the FileUID we check uniqueness, if a collision occurs we generate a new one.   To make the ID non-guessable Pine recommends a HMAC.  The recommendation is to use a secure random number generator like openssl but using for example /dev/urandom or mtrand and hash that combined with a salt value to an HMAC is sufficiently secure.  FileSender would need to auto-generate the salt value.\n\nPine comments that wile an attacker in this way won't be able to directly know the random number you have to be very careful you don't leak random number to user somewhere. \n\n*Response:*  Etienne will add HMAC with a random generated salt and look at making it configurable to read urandom or use mt_rand.\n","2015-03-06T16:02:09.000+00:00","2015-03-11T11:03:16.000+00:00",6605143,null,"dPS9kyuyur3zYrab7jnrAJ","2015-03-11T11:03:16.000+00:00",0.0,0,-17.0,0,0,447388,0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,"2015-03-11T11:03:16.000+00:00",null]

This function currently filters the input for a number of dangerous characters and adds a space to them. Pine recommends to use escaping, the current code uses filtering.\n\nFiltering changes the input and might lead to unexpected side-effects.\n\n*Assessment*: Etienne's collegues in the Sympa mailinglist software project had a security audit executed where an issue was found using variable encoded string injection.  The offending string had to be machine-generated.  This string defeated perls regexp-based entity encoding mechanism.  The php mechanism behaved the same.  Sympa introduced a filtering fix which was reported in this FileSender audit.  \nThe filtering fix was based on a blog-article published on OWASP as a recommendation.  Unfortunately the blog article is now no longer accessible. \n\nDaan indicated he's unaware of any technique to bypass html_entities.  He tested by removing the line of code and injection of code was not possible.

Based on the experience of the Sympa mailinglist software team escaping alone might not be enough.  The issue found in the Sympa security audit might now have been fixed and the filtering fix no longer needed.  We will await the results of the 2nd security audit and then decide what to do.

This may lead to a situation where a user can overwrite any variable in the current symbol table like a path variable and include a php script controlled by the user like a php script included in a URL.  At the moment this is not exploitable as the user doesn't control the keys that are provided with the vars parameter.

For the time being we will keep this as it is and gather practical experience with the template mechanism.\n\nDetails: In the template class there's a method that when called renders a template.  This method looks for a template, resolves the template path (is it in the config directory because it's a customised template or is it in the default template directory?).  Then it includes that template file if found while creating on the fly a set of varilables that the template will use.  The method is given an associated array of key-value pairs (foo=bar) and creates variables for use in the template with name 'foo' and value 'bar'.     .

Hesitating between rewrite using some kind of keystore or filtering given variables before creating variables so they don't contain unexpected stuff like globals etc., path variable.  The latter approach is error-prone, every time we introduce variable we also need to update the filter.\n\nWhen rendering for example a report at end of upload, the template process method with template name \"report\" can have a variable report=array of report objects.  In template code this then allows for a construct like \"foreach $report as report do ....\".  \n\nThis mechanism is to make for easier template writing.

The file is however correctly downloaded and usable.  \n\nThe \"Content-Dispositon\" problem\n\nAt the moment the labeling of a string as UTF-8 encoded is not done when a file containing special characters is downloaded. The download process uses the HTTP Content-Disposition header with a filename parameter.
